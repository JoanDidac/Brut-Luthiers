          <h2 class="hidden">Guitar model :Specs</h2>
          <p class="hidden">Description >>> This gorgeous acoustic bass guitar is built from a reclaimed local old-growth redwood top, Honduras rosewood sides & back, curly maple binding/heelcap, ebony bridge/fretboard/peghead overlay, and a Honduras mahogany neck. The redwood & rosewood are the same as David’s recent redwood-rosewood parlor guitar.

            Its 31″ scale results in easy playability and reach, while still holding onto its dynamic punch.
            
            Like its cousin parlor guitar, this bass also features a soundport, on the player’s side upper bout. The soundport acts as a monitor, directing sound waves towards the player’s ears as well as from the front aperture.</p>
